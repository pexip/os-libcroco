Description: Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) parsing and manipulation toolkit
 Services provided by Libcroco
  * A parser module that provides
    o A SAC like API. SAC stands for Simple API for CSS. SAC is an event driven
      API which resembles SAX in the xml world.
    o A CSSOM like API. CSSOM stands for Cascading Style Sheet Object Model.
 .
    The libcroco parser implements the CSS Level 2 specification, the CSS
    forward compatibility rules and the CSS cascading rules.
 .
  * A CSS2 selection engine
    Given an xml element node (that obviously comes from an xml document) and
    a stylesheet cascade, the Libcroco selection engine can evaluate the css
    selectors of the cascade and return the style properties associated to
    the xml element node.
 .
    Note that the xml manipulation toolkit used by the libcroco selection
    engine at the moment is libxml2.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static libraries which is
 needed for developing the GTK+ applications.

 can be used for testing CSS correctness.
